## Internship (2021) : about the finite element method 

First year master degree internship, under the supervision of Michel Duprez. This internship was an introduction to the standard finite element method and has for objective to discover a new method called $\phi$-FEM introduced by Michel Duprez, Vanessa Lleras and Alexeï Lozinski in \[[paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02521111)] and \[[paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02521042v3)]. 

During this internship, we also introduced a new $\phi$-FEM approach to solve Poisson problem with mixed boundary conditions, linear elasticity problems (Dirichlet conditions, Neumann conditions and mixed boudnary conditions).

## About the parareal in time algorithm

First year of Master degree project. This project is a kind of introduction to ODEs resolution. 
More precisely, we discuss here about different schemes to solve these equations and the Parareal algorithm introduced by Jacques-Louis Lions, Yvon Maday and Gabriel Turinici (in *Résolution d'EDP par un schéma en temps «pararéel »*).
